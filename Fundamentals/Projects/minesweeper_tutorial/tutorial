#first we break the game into steps 

#Step 1: Create the board
#Step 2: Plant the bombs 
#Step 3: Show the board to the player and get a location to dig 
#Step 4a: If the location has a bomb then show game over message and end the game
# Step 4b: If the location doesn't have a bomb then dig recursively till all currently dug locations are next to a bomb
#Step 5: repeat steps 3 and 4b till there are no more locations to dig

#for the board we create a class that will create a new board and plant the bombs
